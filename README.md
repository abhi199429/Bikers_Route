# Bikers_Route

This repository is dedicated to an android app which uses AWS Mobile Hub using AWS Lambda as Backend as a Service. Basically, we implemented several lambda function in AWS backend. We have data stored in DynamoDB, so we can easily interect with those data using implemented lambda functions. The feature of app is to show route of biker using previous data and keeps track of number of times he went through the road. The fun part was to implement lambda function and merge AWS functionalities with my local android studio app.
